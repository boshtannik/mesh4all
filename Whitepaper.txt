This is the whitepaper for the one layer multi purpose mesh protocol:

The protocol lets building one layer mesh network with all nodes sharing same instuctions
following same rules

OSI Layer 1 (Physical layer):
	* Interchangable

OSI Layer 2 (Data layer):
	* Framing information
	* Local addressing
	* Error detection / correction

OSI Layer 3 (Network layer):
	* Provides end to end delivery mechanism
	* Logical addressing
	* Routing / Forwarding
	* Sometimes fragmentation of packets

OSI Layer 4 (Transport layer):
	* Process to process transport service
	* Reliable / Unreliable transporting
	* Retransmission
	* Sequencing
	* Segmentation and Collecting segments

OSI Layer 5 (Session layer):
