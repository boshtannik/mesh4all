Mesh4All (M4A) - one layer next generation mesh network protocol:

Goals:
    * Build next generation way of interconnecting devices:
        * Computers
        * Microcontrollers
        * Mobile devices
        * IoT devices
        * etc.,

    * Be integratable into already existing network infrastructure. (Later goal)
    * Be simple in use.
    * Provide secure way of data exchange by default.
    * Zero conf network.
    * Provide scalable, network with option to:
        Establish connection for start session.
        Reestablish connection to maintain session.
        Optimize connection to balance load on network.

Terms:
    Node - Device running Instance of M4A protocol. It can be:
           * Firmware running on microcontroller.
    	   * One of instances of process working on computer.
    	   * Router with Mesh4All protocol installed.

    Address - Is the unit of addressing, used within this protocol.
              It is used by node to distinguish it's closest neighbor node.
              The size of 1 Address unit depends on specified value, which says
              how many bytes 1 Address unit uses.
              So the value of address.

    Path - Is the sequence of Address unit values that describes which nodes
    	the packet should be transferred trough - to reach it's destination.

    	The length of path is also specified within the header.

        For 1 byte Address size with length of 4 path in hopss it looks like:
        156.208.16.24

        For 1 byte Address with the length of path of 2 hops:
        132.127

        For 2 bytes Address with the length of path of 5 hops:
        65530.128.312.64.32330

    Path exploration - Process of establishing the shortest or fastest
                       path between nodes. The way of establishing of path
                       partially inspired by ant colony path finding algorithm.
                       The way it works - is provided in "Path exploration"
                       section below.

    Path initiation device - Device that starts the process of path exploration
                             to responding device.

    Path responding device - Device that has "greeting-init" message received,
                             decrypts it, and sends encrypted
                             "greeting-response".

    Greeting-init - Packet that contains the flag, that tells that the packet
                    is used to find path to the device, which will be able to
                    decrypt and respond to originator of that message.

    Greeting-response - Packet that contains the flag, that tells that this
                        packet is used to provide explored packet to the
                        originator of Path exploration device with the sequence
                        of Address'es to provide to the originator explored
                        path to use.

In first of all, no Node has path to other node to communicate after
being initialized. Every node boots with any random value of Address - so
the network is always dynamic.

To establish path between nodes, they use the Path exploration process.

Path exploration principle description:
    Path exploration was inspired by natural phenomena, named as ant colony
    path finding algorithm.

    Each device communicates with other only by:
    Establishing connection via pairs of secret phrases or keypairs.

    In that phase node does not know path to other node to communicate, so it
    has to establish the connection by exploring the path trough the network.

    1 - Initiation device sends encrypted "greeting-init" message into the
        ether and waits for remote device to decrypt it and respond with it's
        own encrypted "greeting-response" which Initiation device can decrypt.

    2 - While "greeting-init" packet travelling trough the network,
        each transit device reduces value of lifetime by 1, if the value is
        still valuable - device adds it's own address to the path, recauculates
        checksum of the packet. If device can not decrypt the "greeting-init"
        then it transits the packet back into the ether. Otherwise it handles
        it as it is described in Destination reached section.

    3 - Destination reached - on explore packet has reached it's destination
        (device which can decrypt greeting message and respond with encrypted
        "greeting-response" message) - the node waits for some period of time
        to recieve similar greeting-init messages that went by other paths,
        in order to later compare those paths and choose the best one based
        on the one of strategies
        (PATH_OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY):
            * Shortest path
            * Fastest path
            * Use All

    4 - After best path has been chosen, device sends "greeting-response"
        packet by the reversed explored path to the originator of the
        "greeting-init" packet.

Pros and cons of protocol:
    * No need to configure network by hand.
        it finds and remembers the paths between nodes automatically.
        (Zero configuration network)

	* Unlike the idea of port number in ipv4 - M4A uses additional Address to:
	    * Distinguish specific program instance running on computer.
		* Simplify of protocol's logic.
		* If multiple network services works salmunteinously on
		    the same machine - they still can be distinguished by
		    their own additional Address.
		* If processor runs only 1 instance of application - there is no extra
		    need to bind firmware with additional addressing Address. So whole
		    device can use only one addressing Address for it's firmware and
		    no port numbers are needed.

	* Has variable path length between nodes.

	* Follows the principles of safety and autonomy.

	* Flat 1 layer network with no need of external network governing.

This protocol operates in 2 - 5 layers of OSI model.

OSI Layer 1 (Physical layer):
	* Interchangable

OSI Layer 2 (Data layer):
    * Has 1 Address.
	* Framing information.
	* Local addressing.
	* Error detection / correction.

OSI Layer 3 (Network layer):
    * Manages whole path of Address'es.
	* Provides end to end delivery mechanism.
	* Logical addressing.
	* Routing / Forwarding.
	* Sometimes fragmentation of packets.

OSI Layer 4 (Transport layer):
	* (Reliable / Unreliable) transporting.

	* Segmentation and Collecting segments.

OSI Layer 5 (Session layer):
