Mesh4All (M4A) - one layer multi purpose mesh network protocol:

Goal:
	Build one layer mesh network out of all available
	hardware which is available today on the market:
	* Microcontrollers + radio modules
	* Personal computers

Node - Instance of M4A protocol. It can be:
				* One of instances of process working on computer.
				* Instance of firmware on the microcontroller.
				* M4A router.

Octet - Unit of addressing, used within this protocol.

Path - Is the sequence of octets that describes which nodes
				the packet should be transferred trough to reach
				it's destination.

Pros and cons of protocol:
	* Uses 'octet' addressing for every node.
	* Unlike the port in ipv4 - uses octet to distinguish
			specific program instance running on computer.
			It leads to simplification of protocol's logic.
	* Has variable path length between nodes.
	* Secure communication.
	* Communication can not be violated.

This protocol operates in 2 - 5 layers of OSI model.

OSI Layer 1 (Physical layer):
	* Interchangable

OSI Layer 2 (Data layer):
	* Framing information
	* Local addressing
	* Error detection / correction

OSI Layer 3 (Network layer):
	* Provides end to end delivery mechanism
	* Logical addressing
	* Routing / Forwarding
	* Sometimes fragmentation of packets

OSI Layer 4 (Transport layer):
	* (Reliable / Unreliable) transporting
	* Retransmission
	* Segmentation and Collecting segments

OSI Layer 5 (Session layer):
